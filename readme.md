# Plugin to Allow COD for First Order Only
Version: 1.0
This plugin allows users to use the COD (cash on delivery) payment method for their first order, but not for subsequent orders.

## Requrement:
1. WordPress
2. WooCommerce plugin

## Installation
1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/cod-first-order-only directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

## Usage
When a user places their first order, they will be able to select the COD payment method on the checkout page.
If the user has placed an order before, the COD payment method will not be available on the checkout page, and an error message will be displayed above the "Place order" button indicating that they are not eligible to use COD for their next order.
